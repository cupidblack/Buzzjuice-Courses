HEALTH & SAFETY DIPLOMA

DEVELOPED BY
KOWARE’S R&D DEPARTMENT
BLUE CROWN ACADEMY

Introductory Notes – Health & Safety Diploma Framework
Koware is a lifestyle company committed to building a vibrant community where content creators can connect, collaborate, and grow together.
As part of its broader lifestyle concept, the Koware Governing Council has tasked its Research & Development Department – BlueCrown Academy – to design and develop a Health & Safety Diploma Program. This initiative aims to provide Koware members with essential health and safety knowledge they can incorporate into their personal and professional lives. The program will be hosted and delivered online through the Buzzjuice Courses platform.
Beyond serving Koware members, the program presents an opportunity to extend health and safety education to the general public, beginning with close contacts of members and the local community, and later expanding to a wider audience. Future plans include offering tailored lesson modules to primary schools (P1–P6/P7), junior high schools, and senior high schools.
Integrating this program into Ghana’s formal education curriculum would enhance nationwide health and safety awareness and, over time, raise overall safety standards within the Ghanaian community.
Successful integration will require collaboration and alignment with recognized international health & safety bodies such as NEBOSH, ILO, OSHA, and ISO, as well as engagement with the Ghana Ministry of Education and the Ghana Tertiary Education Commission (formerly National Accreditation Board).
Program Launch Plan
Initially, the first two courses in the diploma program will be offered online to Koware members, forming a prerequisite for joining Koware’s Affiliate Program. Subsequently, the program will also be delivered in-person to residents of Oxford House Ghana, as part of the halfway house’s reintegration program.
This staged rollout will serve as a pilot phase, allowing the program to be presented to potential dignitaries, sponsors, and partners.
Unique Program Features
One defining feature of the diploma is the inclusion of elective courses at each level, allowing students to tailor their learning. Upon completion of the diploma, each student’s performance will undergo a career suitability analysis to suggest two potential professions where the student is most likely to excel and enjoy success. These suggestions will be influenced by the elective courses chosen and will be displayed on the student’s certificate. Additional career suggestions can be requested for a small fee.

Current Key Priorities
1. Copyrighting the diploma program, course structures, and lesson content.
2. Identifying and engaging key players, partners, and sponsors.
3. Developing an integration roadmap for Ghana’s primary, JHS, and SHS curricula.
4. Establishing effective assessment methods and tools.
5. Defining registration processes and policies for non-Koware members.
Registration Process (Preliminary Concept)
* Students must register through a recognized local institution (e.g., tutoring center, library, or primary school) that has the necessary facilities and support systems for the program.
This ensures students have access to physical support, resources (such as a computer lab or library), and a secure examination environment.
* Students will be required to take their examinations at their registered institution.
* Agreements (e.g., MOUs) will be established between BlueCrown Academy and the participating institutions to define responsibilities, ensure authenticity, and protect the integrity of the program.
* A fair compensation model will be developed to ensure partner institutions are adequately rewarded for providing facilities and support services.







The following outline documents the program’s basic structure and content.

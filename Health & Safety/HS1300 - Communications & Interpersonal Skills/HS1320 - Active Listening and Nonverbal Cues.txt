?? HS1321 – Active Listening
Definition: Fully focusing on, understanding, responding to, and remembering a speaker’s message.
Techniques:
* ?? Paraphrase: Repeat key points in your own words.
* ?? Reflect emotions: Acknowledge feelings (“You seem concerned about…”).
* ?? Clarify: Ask questions to remove ambiguity.
* ?? Nonverbal reinforcement: Eye contact, nodding, open posture.

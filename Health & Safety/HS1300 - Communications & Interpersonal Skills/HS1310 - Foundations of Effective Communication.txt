?? SECTION A – DEFINING COMMUNICATION
Definition: Communication is the process of sending, receiving, and interpreting messages — verbal or non-verbal — to exchange information, influence behaviour, and build shared understanding.
Core Elements:?? Sender??? Message??? Channel??? Receiver??? Feedback??? Noise (barriers)
Models of Communication:
* Linear Model (one-way): e.g., a safety notice or memo.
* Interactive Model (two-way): adds feedback loops, used during toolbox talks.
* Transactional Model: both parties exchange meaning simultaneously — most realistic in daily teamwork and safety operations.

?? SECTION B – WHY COMMUNICATION MATTERS IN HEALTH & SAFETY
? Prevents accidents: Clear instructions and feedback loops reduce near-misses.
? Builds trust: Workers follow procedures when communication is respectful and consistent.
? Improves incident reporting: Accurate, honest reporting prevents repeated mistakes.
? Encourages inclusion: Culturally aware communication ensures all workers understand, regardless of literacy or language.
Ghanaian Context:
???? Use clear English supported by local languages (Twi, Ga, Ewe).
Respect hierarchy but encourage open feedback.
Be concise and visual when giving instructions (charts, signage, demonstrations).

?? SECTION C – COMMUNICATION STYLES & ADAPTATION
Common Styles
?? Assertive: direct but respectful (best for safety-critical commands).
?? Passive: used for counselling or support situations.
?? Analytical/Formal: written reports, audits, compliance documents.
Adapting for Clarity
?? Use plain language — short sentences, active verbs.
?? Confirm understanding — ask workers to repeat instructions (“teach-back”).
?? Reinforce messages with visuals and demonstrations.
?? Keep sessions short (toolbox talks 3–10 minutes).

?? SECTION D – COMMUNICATION BARRIERS & SOLUTIONS
Typical Barriers:
* Noise (machinery, background activity)
* Literacy/language challenges
* Emotional stress or fear of authority
* Cultural reluctance to question supervisors
Solutions:
? Use interpreters or bilingual staff.
? Choose quiet settings for critical briefings.
? Offer written summaries or checklists.
? Foster a blame-free environment for open feedback.



?? SECTION E – ETHICAL COMMUNICATION PRINCIPLES
PrincipleDescriptionH&S ExampleHonestyReport incidents truthfullyAvoid covering up near-missesRespectTreat everyone with dignityAvoid public blameResponsibilityShare accurate info with those who need itKeep medical details confidentialBalance Transparency and Privacy: Share safety lessons while protecting personal details.

?? Case Study – “Toolbox Talk Miscommunication (Accra Construction Site)”
Scenario:
A supervisor gave a verbal handover without written confirmation. A worker misunderstood the permit scope and began work on live equipment — a near-miss occurred.
Learning Points:
* No written checklist or feedback verification.
* Worker hesitant to question due to cultural hierarchy.
* Delay in honest reporting breached ethical standards.
Discussion Questions:
1. What could have prevented the misunderstanding?
2. How might culture influence this outcome?
3. What ethical actions are required after such incidents?

HS1130: Fitness & Strength 
? Lesson Aim
Equip learners with safe, practical fitness routines to improve strength, flexibility, and endurance, integrate movement into domestic tasks, prevent injury, and sustain motivation through small support groups.
?? Learning Outcomes
After this lesson, learners will be able to:
* Define FITT, progressive overload, recovery, and the talk-test.
* Build a 1-week plan mixing cardio, strength, and flexibility in-home or around residential perimeter.
* Demonstrate a safe 10–20 minute micro routine.
* Organize a 3–4 person neighborhood support strategy.
* Produce a household perimeter walk+exercise routine to reduce sedentary time.

?? HS1131 - Core Concepts (Icons: Emoji/SVG)
* ? FITT — Frequency / Intensity / Time / Type
Example: 4× week (Frequency), moderate intensity (talk test), 20 min (Time), brisk walk + strength (Type).
* ?? Progressive Overload — increase reps/time by ~5–10% weekly
* ?? Recovery — sleep, hydration, rest day, active recovery
* ?? Best Times — 10–30 min after domestic/perimeter chores or early morning pre-work
* ?? Talk Test — speak a sentence comfortably during moderate intensity; prevents overexertion

?? HS1132 - Practical Exercises (Space-Efficient)
Indoor & Residential Perimeter Options:
* ? Bodyweight Squats — chest up, knees track toes
* ? Incline Push-ups (wall/bed/bench) — straight body line, hands under shoulders
* ? Walking/Jogging Intervals — 20-min loop: 5-min walk warm-up, 5-min brisk pace, 5-min strength stops, 5-min cool-down
* ? Farmer’s Carry (water jugs) — grip/core strength
* ? Step-ups / Stair climb — use steps or compound steps
* ? Plank & Side-plank — 30–45s sets
Sample 15-Min Micro Routine (No Equipment):
1. 2 min brisk walk/march on spot (warm-up)
2. 30 sec squats ? 20 sec rest × 3 sets
3. 30 sec incline push-ups ? 20 sec rest × 3 sets
4. 30 sec alternating lunges ? 20 sec rest × 2 sets
5. 45 sec plank ? 60 sec cooldown stretch

?? HS1133 - Integration with Domestic Tasks
* Best practice: immediately after household/perimeter chore (muscles warm, 10–30 min window)
* Example: After sweeping yard (10–15 min) ? 20-min perimeter walk ? stop midway for 5 min bodyweight set ? jog back
* Mixes utility with fitness; minimizes extra time

?? HS1134 - Team-Up Strategy (3–4 People)
* Schedule: 3×/week, 20 min/session (06:00–06:20 or 17:00–17:20)
* Roles: Leader (rotate), Timekeeper, Safety Monitor, Motivator
* Activities:
o Day 1: jog/walk intervals
o Day 2: bodyweight circuit
o Day 3: sport or mobility routine
* Accountability: WhatsApp check-in, attendance chart, weekly 5-min progress reflection
* Safety: warm-up together, buddy-check, agreed stop signs for pain/emergency

??? HS1135 - Injury Prevention & Safe Technique
* Warm-up 5 min; cool-down 3–5 min
* Use RPE or talk test to regulate intensity
* Progress gradually (5–10% rule)
* Avoid sudden jerky movements; maintain neutral spine
* Stop if sharp pain occurs; DOMS normal 24–48h


?? HS1138 - Real Case Study — Ghana Market Porter
* Context: Market porter with long walking & load-carrying hours added micro-strength sessions & perimeter walks ? reduced back pain & improved stamina in 6–8 weeks
* Demonstration video: HASfit — 15-Min Beginner Bodyweight Workout (15:04) ? Watch here
* Discussion prompts:
o Which porter tasks double as strength training?
o How to schedule sessions around market hours?
o Recovery actions for overuse?

? HS1139 – Discussion Quiz & Resources (5Q)
1. Define FITT & give one adjustment example for someone exercising 30 min/day.
2. Name 3 signs of overtraining & immediate action for each.
3. List 2 at-home strength exercises & one key form cue each.
4. Sketch a 20-min perimeter routine after sweeping yard; include 4-week progressive overload.
5. For a 3–4 person group, list 3 accountability actions for adherence & safety.

?? Mini-Assignment
* 150–250 words: select one Ghanaian daily activity (e.g., fetching water, market selling). Identify 3 hazards & risks, propose 3 adapted fitness moves, create 30-day & 90-day plan. Optional: 60-sec demo video upload.

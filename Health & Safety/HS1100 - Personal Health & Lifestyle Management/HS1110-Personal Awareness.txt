?? HS1111 - Core Concepts
?? Self-awareness = conscious knowledge of your values, beliefs, emotions, habits, strengths and limits.
? Types: Public (what others perceive) vs Private (inner states).
? Johari Window (Luft & Ingham, 1955): Open / Blind / Hidden / Unknown panes. (Communication Theory)
[CALL-OUT: In Ghanaian workplaces (e.g., informal markets, SMEs) feedback/peer exercises may need cultural adjustment to ensure respect and trust.]
? Emotional Intelligence: awareness + management of emotions leads to better decision-making, interpersonal effectiveness.
Daniel GolemanThe?4?domains of emotional intelligence

?? HS1112 - Practical Micro-Tools
1. ? Emotional Intelligence Micro-tool:
o ? Recognise: notice the bodily cue (e.g., tight chest, shallow breath).
o ? Name: label the emotion (“I’m frustrated”, “I feel anxious”).
o ? Breathe: take 3 diaphragm breaths (inhale 4s / hold 1s / exhale 6s).
o ? Choose: pick one constructive action (pause, ask for time, reframe).
2. ? 5–7 minute Mindfulness Check-In
o 1 min settle; 3-4 min breathing or body-scan; 1-2 min set intention.
o Best times: early morning (before devices) or mid-shift break.
3. ? Johari Window Pair Activity (10 min)
o Share an observed strength + a blind-spot to the other (respectful, specific).
o Record one action to work on during next 7 days.

?? HS1113 - Real Case Study
Rana Plaza Collapse (Savar, Bangladesh 2013) – The disaster demonstrates how weak worker voice, low awareness of risk cues and inadequate feedback culture contributed to over 1 100 deaths and many injuries.
? Video (approx 12 min): “Rana Plaza: The Collapse That Shook the World” – DW Documentary (YouTube) https://youtu.be/Mq_mTnhoxEY (verified 06-Nov-2025)
Class prompts: What warning signs were missed? How could stronger self-awareness, feedback or worker voice changed outcomes? What parallels in Ghana workplace settings?

?? HS1115 - Common Elements
It is best to practice all elements daily before sleep and immediately when waking up.
1. ?? Focus - Attention Training – (Color: None)
o How: Build stable attention - single-point focus (counting breaths) Daily devotionals can be a source of inspirational focus, 10–15 min/day.
o Best time: Morning before devices or a mid-shift break.
2. ??? Breathing - Breath Regulation – (Color: White)
o How: Refreshed Breathing: Diaphragmatic, smooth, deep belly breathing; exhale fully; don’t hold your breath; keep tongue on the palate; breathe to ~70% capacity; supports physiological selfregulation (e.g., box 4:4:4 or coherent breathing); 5–15 min.
o Best time: Pre-task or breaks.
3. ?? Physical - Body Awareness & Interoception – (Color: Red)
o How: Sense your bodily signals - body scan, mindful walking/movement (Tai Chi, Qigong); 10–20 min sessions 3-5×/week; daily 1–2 min posture checks.
o Best time: Morning warm-up or evening unwind.
4. ?? Emotional Recognition – (Color: Orange)
o How: Aligned Flow: Etheric Emotion-Balanced Emotions – Identify intense emotions, understand and isolate the energy, calm and release it. Use “Recognise ? Name ? Breathe ? Choose”, a feelings chart, or 2–3 line journaling to notice, process, and relax emotions.
o Best time: After events or end of shift.


5. ?? Affirmations - Cognitive Reflection & Reframing – (Color: Yellow)
o How: Eight Flex Resolves: Mental – Clear the mind, focus on the devotion, identify its source, derive meaning, meditate, stay present, remain open-minded, and reframe thoughts (CBT: stop & reframe, brief reflections).
o Best time: Quiet time (weekend or non-working hour).
6. ?? Peace - Values, Purpose & Intention – (Color: Green)
o How: Eternal Pulsation: Psychic – Being at peace: Cultivate relatedness, care, understanding, and environmental awareness. Align actions with values using a lifebalance map and SMART goal.
o Best time: Start of day/week or module.
7. ?? Awareness - Social Practice & Feedback – (Color: Blue)
o How: Spiral Expansion: Casual Karmic – Expanding self-awareness: Immediate, External, Local, Channelled, and Enhanced awareness. Apply in social contexts via Johari pairs, active listening, and feedback circles.
o Best time: Facilitated group sessions.
8. ?? Harmony - Integration: Micro-Habits & Behavioural Routines – (Color: Violet)
o How: Channelled Aspirations: Individuality Essence – Meditate to set or refine aspirations, analyze their components, synchronize energy through the Tantiens (lower, middle, upper), simulate and project goals, and integrate insights into daily routines using habit stacking, micro-pauses, reflection, and gratitude.
o Best time: Tied to existing routines (after breakfast, before sleep).
9. ?? Aspirations - Measurement, Feedback & Iteration – (Color: Purple)
o How: Monitor progress and refine - logs (stress scale 1-10), behavioural tracking (sleep hours, errors), optional HRV or step count; weekly check-ins; monthly review.
o Best time: Weekly recap/reflect.
10. ?? Virtue - Ethics, Safety & Trauma-Informed Care – (Color: Pink)
o How: Continuous oversight: informed consent, trauma screening, facilitator boundaries, referral pathways (including Ghanaian resources).
o The Eight Virtues: Unity; Filial Piety (respect and care for parents, teachers, elders); Sibling Harmony (peaceful coexistence, respect for others); Dedication (loyalty, commitment); Trustworthiness (honesty, keeping promises); Propriety (courtesy, manners); Sacrifice (courage, selflessness, purity of purpose); Honour (integrity, earning what you deserve); Sense of Shame (awareness and avoidance of wrongful actions).
o Best time: Always.

HS1520 — Understanding the Impact of Technology on Daily Life 
?? LESSON AIM
Explain how technology shapes communication, work, education and leisure; understand the digital divide; evaluate local innovations and HSE implications; and design practical local mitigations for technology-related safety and wellbeing risks.

? 60MINUTE LESSON FLOW (TIMED)
00:00–05:00 — Welcome, outcomes, icebreaker: “What technology did you use today?” (Learner poll)
05:00–15:00 — Personal communication & social interactions: benefits, risks, HSE impacts (short clip + discussion)
15:00–25:00 — Automation & AI: effects on work, education & leisure; HSE consequences (minilecture + video)
25:00–35:00 — The Digital Divide: access, equity, Ghana realities, quick group brainstorm
35:00–45:00 — Innovations & modern lifestyles: mobile money, telehealth, edtech, drone logistics (case study)
45:00–52:00 — Group breakout: local hazard/benefit mapping (upload to LearnDash)
52:00–58:00 — Quiz / plenary discussion (choose 3 of 5 questions)
58:00–60:00 — Assignment brief & LearnDash submission guidance





? HS1521 - Hazard vs Risk
* Hazard = source with potential to cause harm (e.g., misinformation, insecure app)
* Risk = likelihood × consequence of harm (e.g., data breach likelihood × impact on user safety/privacy)
* Aim: reduce harm to ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable)

?? HS1522 - Technology & Personal Communication
* Benefits: instant connection, remote work/learning, telemedicine, business platforms (market access)
* Risks: misinformation, cyberbullying, erosion of facetoface skills, privacy breaches, attention fragmentation
* HSE impacts: increased screen time ? eye strain, sleep disruption, sedentariness, poor posture
* Mitigations: digital breaks, ergonomic setup, verified information literacy

?? HS1523 - Automation & AI
* Benefits: reduces repetitive manual exposure to hazardous tasks, improves logistics & diagnostics
* Risks: job displacement, algorithmic bias, complacency/over-reliance, cybersecurity vulnerabilities
* HSE considerations: system safety, maintenance regimes, humanintheloop design, retraining & mental health supports




?? HS1524 - Digital Divide — Dimensions & Ghana Context
* Dimensions: Infrastructure, Affordability, Skills, Relevance
* Ghana realities: high urban mobile penetration; rural gaps in internet, power reliability and local digital skills
* Mitigations: community digital hubs, SMSfirst services, radio + offline learning packs, public charging stations, basic digital literacy workshops

?? HS1525 - Technological Innovations & Modern Lifestyles
* Mobile Money (e.g., MTN MoMo): financial inclusion vs fraud & stress ? mitigations: user education, transaction alerts, dispute mechanisms
* Telehealth: increased access vs data privacy & misdiagnosis risk ? mitigations: secure platforms, clinician protocols, clear consent
* EdTech: blended learning increases reach; risk of exclusion for lowconnectivity learners ? mitigations: blended radio/print + offline resources
* Drone logistics (Zipline): rapid medical supply deliveries; HSE considerations include airspace safety, privacy, community acceptance

?? HS1526 - Personal Wellbeing & Digital Use
* Ergonomics: neutral posture, screen at eye level, frequent microbreaks, correct chair/table heights
* Digital wellness: set screenfree windows, curtail night usage, verify news sources, practice mindful consumption


?? HS1528 - Case Study — Zipline Drone Medical Delivery (Ghana)
* Summary: Autonomous drone deliveries of blood, vaccines, and medical supplies to remote clinics — reduces delivery times and improves health outcomes.
* HSE / STS Considerations: Faster response, improved cold-chain reliability, rural access; risks include airspace safety, emergency landings, noise, operator competence, data privacy
* Class Activity (7–10 min):
1. Watch BBC clip (cue 0:00–4:30)
2. In groups, list 2 technical benefits, 2 safety/ethical risks, and propose 3 mitigations (engineering, administrative, engagement)
3. Upload 100–150 word summary to LearnDash
Sample mitigations
* Engineering: geofencing, redundant navigation, emergency landing protocols
* Administrative: maintenance schedules, licensed operators, flight corridors, reporting
* Community engagement: pre-deployment briefings, complaint mechanisms, privacy safeguards








? HS1529 – Quiz Discussions & Resources
   (choose 3 in class, assign all 5 as follow-up)
1. Identify 2 positive and 2 negative effects of smartphones on social life in Ghana. Recommend HSE mitigations.
2. Explain the 4 main dimensions of the digital divide. Propose 1 low-cost local intervention per dimension.
3. Choose an AI application (e.g., automated grading, clinical triage). Identify 2 HSE risks & propose controls.
4. For Zipline: propose 1 engineering control, 1 administrative control, 1 community engagement action. Explain impact.
5. Draft a 100-word blended learning plan for a rural school with intermittent power and limited internet.

?? ASSESSMENT & LEARNDASH SUBMISSION
   (due within 7 days)
* Mandatory: Local Plan (? 400 words) — identify 1 technology in a Ghanaian community/workplace, list 3 HSE/social risks, propose feasible mitigations, ownership & 30-/90-day timeline
* Optional: 60–90 sec mobile video: describe local tech benefit/hazard + one feasible control
* Rubric highlights: Localization & clarity (30%), HSE risk identification (30%), feasibility of mitigations (25%), ownership & timeline (15%)

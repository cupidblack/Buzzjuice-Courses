HS1530: Foundational Safety Principles in Everyday Contexts 
?? Lesson Aim
To help learners understand everyday safety concepts—hazards, risks, prevention, and preparedness—and to apply foundational safety principles across home, community, and work settings in Ghana.

?? Learning Outcomes
By the end of this 60-minute session, students should be able to:
?? Define hazard, risk, and prevention, giving Ghanaian examples.
?? Apply the 5-step risk assessment to a real daily activity.
?? Outline a basic home or community emergency plan.
?? Identify human factors that influence unsafe behavior and suggest corrective actions.

?? HS1532 - Daily Safety Checklist
Use these practical actions daily:
?? Check electrical plugs, cords, and sockets regularly.
?? Keep fuel or gas containers away from heat sources.
?? Clear exits and stairways — ensure no obstructions.
?? Prepare a home emergency kit (water, torch, radio, first aid).
?? Apply the “2-Minute Rule”: if safe to fix quickly, do it; if not, report it.




?? HS1533 - Human Factors in Safety
?? Video: Energy Institute — “Human Factors in Five Minutes”
Influencing Factors:
* Fatigue and overwork
* Complacency or “shortcuts”
* Distraction and poor attention
* Cultural or social pressure (“everyone does it this way”)
Prevention Strategies:
? Training and refresher sessions
? Toolbox talks and reminders
? Rest breaks and shift rotation
? Leadership modeling safe practices
? Encourage a “no-blame” reporting culture

?? HS1534 - Tips & Quick Reminders
?? Tip Box (Green background — #E6F4EA)
“Safety starts with awareness — every hazard you ignore today may become tomorrow’s emergency.”
?? Warning Box (Yellow background — #FFF4E5)
“Never use wet hands to handle electrical plugs or cords.”
?? Fact Box (Gray background — #F6F7F9)
“Over 60% of home accidents in Ghana involve fire, electrocution, or falls — most are preventable through awareness and planning.”

?? HS1538 - Case Study — The 2015 Accra Petrol-Station Explosion
?? Watch: BBC News — Accra Explosion 2015 (verified live)
Summary: Heavy rainfall and poor drainage caused petrol leakage and ignition, leading to a catastrophic fire.
Key Points for Discussion:
1?? Identify three hazards visible in the report.
2?? What immediate and long-term controls could have prevented this?
3?? Which stakeholders (station owners, regulators, NADMO) should act first, and how?

?? HS1539 - Discussion Quiz & Resources
1?? Define hazard and risk; give one Ghanaian example of each.
2?? What are the five steps of a basic risk assessment?
3?? Suggest three measures to prevent flood-related home hazards.
4?? List two human factors that lead to unsafe actions and one way to reduce them.
5?? From the Accra case study, what two immediate actions and two long-term solutions would you recommend?

?? Mini-Assignment
Write 150–250 words on a common Ghanaian daily activity (e.g., cooking with charcoal, okada riding, generator use). Include:
* 3 hazards
* 3 corresponding risks
* 3 control measures (engineering, administrative, behavioral)
Add a 30-day and 90-day safety improvement plan.
(Optional: record a 60-second demo video of one control practice.)

HS1030 — Proactive Safety: Mastering Hazard Identification & Risk Management
?? LESSON AIM
• Equip learners to identify workplace hazards, conduct HIRA using a 5×5 risk matrix, apply the Hierarchy of Controls, and create & maintain a practical risk register for Ghanaian workplaces.

?? HS1031 - Hazard vs Risk
* Hazard — potential source of harm (e.g., frayed cable, chemical spill).
* Risk — likelihood × consequence of that harm.
* Principle: reduce risk to ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable).

?? HS1032 - Common Hazard Types
?? Physical — slips, trips, falls; moving machinery; noise
?? Chemical — fuels, solvents, acids, gases; SDS awareness
?? Biological — contaminated waste, pathogens, mould
?? Ergonomic — poor posture, manual lifting, repetitive tasks
?? Psychosocial — stress, fatigue, harassment, long/unsociable hours

?? HS1033 - HIRA - 6 Practical Steps
1. Identify task/location & list hazards (walkthroughs, staff input, SDS review)
2. Assess consequence & likelihood using 5×5 risk matrix
3. Calculate initial risk rating (L×C ? category)
4. Select controls using Hierarchy of Controls (top-down)
5. Record in Risk Register (owner, target date, residual risk, review)
6. Implement, monitor, review regularly

?? HS1034 - 5×5 Risk Matrix (example)
Likelihood1 Rare2 Unlikely3 Possible4 Likely5 Almost CertainC1 NegligibleLowLowLowMediumMediumC2 MinorLowLowMediumMediumHighC3 ModerateLowMediumMediumHighHighC4 MajorMediumMediumHighHighExtremeC5 CatastrophicMediumHighHighExtremeExtreme
?? HS1035 - Hierarchy of Controls
1. Elimination — remove hazard
2. Substitution — safer alternative
3. Engineering — isolate people from hazard (guards, ventilation)
4. Administrative — procedures, training, signage
5. PPE — last line of defence (gloves, masks, goggles)
?? Ghana Legal Callout
* Labour Act 2003 (Act 651) & Factories, Offices & Shops Act 328 — employers must provide safe systems, PPE, training, and incident reporting.



?? HS1036 - PDCA & Management System Linkage
* HIRA fits within ISO/OSH PDCA cycle: Plan ? Do ? Check ? Act
* HIRA outcomes feed into continuous improvement & management review

?? HS1037 - CASE STUDY — Accra Mini-Bus Overload
Scenario: Overloaded mini-bus; rain causes skid and overturn ? multiple injuries
HazardLikelihoodConsequenceScoreControl ExampleWorn tyres4416 HEng: mandatory tyre checks; Admin: load limits & fatigue policy; PPE: seat beltsActivity: In breakout groups, identify hazards, score, select controls, update Risk Register row, upload to LearnDash.
Systemic Case: Rana Plaza Collapse (DW Documentary, 12:23)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq_mTnhoxEY (cue 7–8?min)
Discuss missed hazards, feasible controls, legal/ethical failures

?? HS1039 -  Discussion Quiz & Resources (5 Questions)
1. Define hazard & risk; give Ghanaian workplace example; score with 5×5 matrix
2. List 5 Hierarchy of Controls levels + Ghana example
3. Frayed extension lead — propose immediate & long-term controls
4. Essential Risk Register columns — justify each
5. Mini-bus case — propose one engineering & one administrative control; explain impact on risk score

?? ASSESSMENT & LEARNDASH SUBMISSION
Mandatory:
* 1-page Risk Register (?5 entries, realistic/simulated workplace)
* 100–150 word reflection on control selection & constraints
Optional:

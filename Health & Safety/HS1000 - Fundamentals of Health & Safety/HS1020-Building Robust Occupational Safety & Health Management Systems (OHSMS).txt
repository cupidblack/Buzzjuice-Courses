HS1020 — Building Robust Occupational Safety & Health Management Systems (OHSMS)
?? LESSON SNAPSHOT
?? Purpose: Explain practical principles, structure, and implementation of an OHSMS; unpack ISO 45001 (PDCA & key clauses) and show pragmatic integration with ISO 9001 & ISO 14001 for Ghanaian workplaces.
? Learning Outcomes (after 60 minutes)
* Define an OHSMS and list its core components.
* Explain ISO 45001 clause structure and apply the PDCA cycle to real OSH tasks.
* Describe a 6-step practical roadmap to implement an OHSMS in a Ghanaian SME.
* Identify 3 integration points between OSH, Quality, and Environment systems.
* Draft 3 measurable KPIs suitable for a small enterprise.

?? HS1021 - Key Concepts
What is an Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS)?: It is a structured management system (policy, planning, support, operation, monitoring, improvement) to prevent harm, meet legal duties, and drive continual OSH improvement.
Core Elements:
?? Policy — short, leadership-signed statement with measurable objectives
?? Leadership & Worker Participation — visible top commitment + consultative worker voice
?? Planning — hazard identification, risk assessment, legal register, objectives
?? Support — competence, training, communication, documented information
?? Operation — procedures, controls, procurement and contractor oversight
?? Performance Evaluation — inspections, audits, incident/near-miss reporting, KPIs
?? Improvement — corrective actions, management review, continual improvement
?? Ghana Legal Callout: Labour Act 2003 (Act 651) & Factories, Offices & Shops Act 328 — employers must ensure safe systems of work, provide PPE, train staff, and report serious incidents.
?? Common Pitfalls:
* Paper-only systems with no workplace follow-through
* No visible leadership or worker consultation
* Ignoring contractor/supply-chain risks
* Tick-box audits instead of actionable learning

?? HS1023 - 6Step Practical Roadmap (SME / GHANA FOCUS)
1. ?? Quick gap analysis & define scope (site, activities)
2. ?? Leadership commitment & publish short OSH policy (signed, measurable)
3. ?? Conduct hazard ID & create 1-page risk register
4. ?? Implement basic controls: Eliminate ? Substitute ? Engineer ? Admin ? PPE
5. ?? Monitoring: weekly inspections, near-miss log, incident reporting, KPI tracking
6. ?? Quarterly management review: close actions, update register, set priorities
?? Templates / Resources (PDF & Excel alternatives):
* Risk Register: PDF Template
* Training Matrix: PDF Example / Excel version

Suggested KPIs: LTIFR, Near-misses/month, % corrective actions closed on time

?? HS1024 - Integration With ISO 9001 & ISO 14001
* High-Level Structure (HLS) alignment
* Integrated QESH policy & Management Review
* Shared KPIs: LTIFR, customer quality issues, % corrective actions closed
?? Activity: Draft 3 integrated KPIs for your workplace (forum, 150 words)

?? HS1025 - Case Study — Bhopal Gas Tragedy (1984)
?? Video (~8 min cued): Bhopal Gas Tragedy
Summary: >3,000 deaths due to process failure & weak OHSMS
Key Lessons:
* Engineering integrity & hazard ID
* Leadership commitment & emergency preparedness
* Worker participation & regulatory compliance
?? Activity: List 3 immediate preventive actions & 2 long-term system improvements; relate one to a Ghanaian SME

?? HS1026 - Personal Wellbeing & Professional Skills
* Healthy routines: sleep, hydration, mental rest
* Active observation & hazard reporting
* Clear communication & ethical investigation
* Empathy & cultural awareness
?? Activity: One-week “Wellbeing & Safety Log” (forum)

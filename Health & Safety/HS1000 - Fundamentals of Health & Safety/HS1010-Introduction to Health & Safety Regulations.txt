HS1010: Foundations of Health & Safety and the Global Regulatory Landscape

?? LESSON SNAPSHOT
This 60-minute lesson introduces the core foundations of Health & Safety (H&S), the global regulatory landscape, and the ethical, legal, and management principles that guide safe practice worldwide.
It integrates Ghana’s legal framework and international bodies such as NEBOSH, ILO, OSHA, and ISO (particularly ISO 45001), and ends with a real case study — the Rana Plaza disaster — with reflection and guided discussion.
?? Learning Outcomes (after 60 minutes)
? Define “Health & Safety” and explain the difference between hazard and risk.
? Identify the roles and relationships of NEBOSH, ILO, OSHA, and ISO.
? Summarize the PDCA (Plan–Do–Check–Act) model of ISO 45001.
? Trace key historical milestones in the evolution of workplace safety.
? Recognize personal wellbeing actions and three essential HSE professional skills.

?? HS1011. Core Concepts & Definitions
?? Health & Safety (H&S) — The organized efforts, systems, and practices designed to prevent injury, illness, and promote the overall wellbeing of individuals in workplaces and public spaces.
Key Terms
? Hazard: Any potential source of harm (e.g., chemicals, noise, wet floors).
? Risk: The likelihood and consequence of harm resulting from a hazard.
? Control Measures: Steps to eliminate or reduce risk.
? Hierarchy of Control: Eliminate ? Substitute ? Engineer ? Administrative ? PPE.
? Duty of Care: The legal and ethical obligation to protect others from harm.
? Wellbeing: Encompasses mental health, fatigue, ergonomics, and lifestyle management.
?? Ghana Context (Callout Box)
The Labour Act 2003 (Act 651) and Factories, Offices & Shops Act 328 require employers to ensure safe systems of work, provide protective equipment, and report serious incidents.
Tip: Encourage practical, low-cost control measures and active reporting in informal sector settings.




?? HS1012. Global Health & Safety Frameworks
1?? NEBOSH — The Knowledge Framework
? Provides professional and vocational qualifications in occupational safety and health.
? Aligns global HSE competency standards and helps employers identify skilled professionals.
2?? ILO — The Policy and Labour Framework
? Sets international conventions and recommendations (e.g., ILO-OSH 2001).
? Guides national policies and social dialogue for decent, safe work.
3?? OSHA — The Enforcement Model (USA)
? Offers practical training materials and inspection guidance.
? Inspires national authorities globally, including Ghana’s Department of Factories Inspectorate.
4?? ISO — The Management-System Framework
? ISO 45001 provides a systematic, auditable structure for occupational safety management.
? Encourages leadership, worker participation, and continuous improvement.
How They Interact
ILO sets global standards ? ISO 45001 operationalizes them in management systems ? NEBOSH professionalizes the workforce ? national regulators (like OSHA or Ghana DFI) enforce compliance.

?? HS1013. Decoding ISO 45001 — The PDCA Model
PLAN — Establish context, identify hazards, set measurable objectives, prepare risk register.
DO — Implement training, communication, operational controls, documentation.
CHECK — Monitor performance, conduct audits, review incidents.
ACT — Implement corrective actions and management reviews for continual improvement.
? Practical Templates (to attach in LearnDash)
1. Simple Risk-Register (columns: hazard, consequence, likelihood, control, owner, review date)
2. Training Matrix (who needs what and when)
3. 5-Item Audit Checklist (quick internal review tool)

?? HS1014. The Evolution & Future of Health & Safety
? Pre-1900s: Industrial revolution hazards, child labour, early welfare reforms.
? 1900s–1950s: Factory Acts, occupational medicine.
? 1970s–1990s: Rise of OSHA, ILO conventions, international cooperation.
? 2000s–Present: ISO 45001 systems thinking, mental health focus, ESG reporting.
? Future: AI-based risk prediction, remote-work ergonomics, global supply-chain accountability.

?? HS1015. Case Study — Rana Plaza (Bangladesh, 2013)
?? Summary:
An eight-storey garment factory collapsed due to ignored structural warnings, killing over 1,100 workers. It remains one of the deadliest industrial disasters in history.
Key Lessons for Practitioners
? Safety culture must be reinforced by engineering integrity and accountability.
? Supply-chain oversight and brand responsibility save lives.
? Worker participation and inspection systems are vital for prevention.
Verified Case Study Video
“Rana Plaza: The Collapse That Shook the World” — DW Documentary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq_mTnhoxEY ? (runtime ? 12 min 23 sec)
Class Activity (45 – 53 min)
– Watch 7–8 minutes of the video (teacher cue).
– Discuss in breakout forum:
?• Three immediate preventive actions.
?• Two long-term system improvements (policy or training).
Reflection Prompt (Forum):
If ISO 45001 had been applied, which clauses (leadership, worker participation, hazard identification, procurement) could have prevented the disaster?

?? HS1016. Personal Wellbeing & Professional HSE Skills
Checklist for Everyday Safety Leadership
? Maintain healthy routines — sleep, nutrition, hydration, mental rest.
? Use active observation — identify and report hazards early.
? Communicate clearly — safety depends on shared understanding.
? Investigate ethically — focus on causes, not blame.
? Practice empathy and cultural awareness.
Mini-Activity (Forum):
Keep a one-week “Wellbeing & Safety Log.” Each day, note one personal wellbeing action and one workplace or community hazard observation.
